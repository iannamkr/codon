Unique items can also be used, giving guardians powerful abilities not found elsewhere in the game. Be careful when using valuable items—anything you give to your guardian is gone forever.
The Guardian uses weapons and shields in the same way as player characters, and can dual wield if two one-handed weapons are animated. If you animate an item type that the Guardian is already using (such as a helmet), the new item will overwrite the old one. Equipping an armour piece restores 25% of its life; equipping one-handed weapons or shields will alternate between left and right hand. You cannot equip two shields.
The Guardian does not share your max amount of curses you can apply to enemies, and therefore functions as a player with the default curse limit when applying curses (through corrupted gloves, for example).
Items: The Guardian&#39;s items are tied to the character that summoned it, rather than the gem itself. Equipping a level 1 version of the gem will disable any items the Guardian cannot equip, which will be present again once a high enough level gem is equipped.
Items deleted on Death: When a Guardian dies, all its equipment is deleted and cannot be recovered. This makes very risky to use powerful or valuable items on an Animated Guardian. It is possible to prevent a body armour worn by a Guardian from being deleted upon Guardian death by crafting the Equipped Animated Guardian drops item on death mod onto it. Note once more that equipment will not be lost upon de-spawning, only death.
Necromantic Aegis: While using Necromantic Aegis your Guardian benefits from its own shield as well as the one you have equipped, allowing it to gain the benefit of two shields at once. Some unique shields can be quite powerful when doubled up this way. If your Guardian is equipped with a two-handed weapon, it will not benefit from your shield.
Player versus Player: Animated Guardians killed in PvP areas will not lose their items. This does not apply to Hall of Grandmasters, even though the map says &quot;PvP damage scaling in effect&quot;. In fact, not only is it possible to lose the Guardian&#39;s items here, but death is very likely because of the way PvP damage scaling works. Minor enemies can instantly kill a Guardian with 50000+ life in this map, so it is highly recommended to despawn your Guardian before attempting.
Item-Granted Skills: Animated guardians cannot use skills granted by items. Equipping items like Death&#39;s Oath, The Rippling Thoughts, or Bubonic Trail will not allow the Guardian to use their associated triggered skills. Fire Burst granted by Essence of Hysteria, even though having no &quot;trigger&quot; or &quot;granted&quot; in its modifier discription, won&#39;t work either. The Guardian is not your party member, and will not be able to use abilities like the one found on Ambu&#39;s Charge. Effects that apply to nearby allies or enemies, like Leer Cast, Victario&#39;s Flight, or Dying Breath, will apply as normal.
Abyssal Sockets: Animate guardians cannot benefit from abyss jewel modifiers. Equipping items like Tombfist or Bubonic Trail with abyss jewel(s) socketed will not grant their modifiers to animate guardian.
Notable items
Life regeneration and percentage increases to life are especially potent on an Animate Guardian because of its huge innate life pool.
The stats displayed in the skills tooltip only accounts for modifiers the skill has, like from the passive tree, jewels, player-equipped items and support gems. It cannot account for further modifiers from things like being affected by an aura, shields through Necromantic Aegis or modifiers from items the AG has equipped. These will not factor into the skills tooltip but are active nonetheless.
Helmet:

Ylfeban&#39;s Trickery - Chance to curse enemies on hit. The triggered skill to create Shocked Ground won&#39;t trigger.
Leer Cast - Aura that grants increased damage.
Mask of the Stitched Demon - Massive life regeneration if the AG gets lots of energy shield from other sources like Grave Intentions and Gravicius&#39;s signature craft for body armour.
Mask of the Tribunal - Various bonuses depending on the attributes provided to the Animate Guardian from other equipped items or The Baron.
Crown of the Tyrant - Huge amount of life for your AG, reduce all elemental resistances of nearby enemies and increase global Fire/Cold/Lightning/Chaos damage to nearby allies.
An influenced helmet with Nearby Enemies take 9% increased &lt;Physical/Elemental&gt; Damage or Nearby Enemies have -9% to &lt;Fire/Cold/Lightning&gt; Resistance. Note that these mods also reduce the defenses of the AG.

Body Armour:

Gruthkul&#39;s Pelt - Life, life regeneration and cold resistance.
Blunderbore - Two Shrines effects on animate Guardian. Free knockback aoe &amp; dmg.
Belly of the Beast - Massive percentage increase to life and resistances.
Zahndethus&#39; Cassock - Creates Consecrated Ground when the AG blocks and chaos resistance.
Ambu&#39;s Charge - Life regeneration if the Animate Guardian has been hit recently, life and resistances. The AG has no party members, so it will not share Endurance Charges.
Garb of the Ephemeral - Cannot be slowed and nearby enemies cannot crit.

Gloves:

Southbound - Percentage increase to life and cold resistance. Note that the AG can no longer kill non-frozen enemies with hits.
Meginord&#39;s Vise - Life regeneration if the strength requirement is met through other equipped items or the player using The Baron.
Hunter-influenced gloves with % chance to Intimidate Enemies for 4 seconds on Hit or % chance to Unnerve Enemies for 4 seconds on Hit

Boots:

Victario&#39;s Flight - Aura that grants increased Movement Speed.
Atziri&#39;s Step - Life and Chance to Dodge Spell Hits.
Kaom&#39;s Roots - Life.
Bubonic Trail - Generally more life then Kaom&#39;s Roots, 1-2 abyssal socket version does not matter as mentioned above. Animated Guardian does not trigger Death Walk.

Weapons and/or Shields:

Singularity - Hinders nearby enemies.
Dying Breath - Aura that grants increased damage and makes curses more effective against affected enemies.
Victario&#39;s Charity - Chance to grant Frenzy Charges on hit and Power Charges on kill. (The replica version of this shield give Frenzy charge on kill, and Endurance charge on hit)
The Oak - Massive life regeneration.
The Anticipation - Intimidate enemies on block.
Kingmaker - Hugely beneficial aura that grants increased item rarity, Culling Strike, Critical Strike Multiplier and Fortify (note: with a very short range of 30 units).
Sign of the Sin Eater - Takes Elemental Ailments instead of you and other Minions. In order to survive being shocked or ignited, the Animate Guardian should be sufficiently tanky.
Oro&#39;s Sacrifice - In combination with Chains of Command
An Influenced weapon with a chance to Intimidate, Unnerver, or inflict Exposure on hit.

Also remember that your Animate Guardian can benefit from Enchantments on Boots and Corruptions.

In most situations, Avatar of Fire will not synergize with Elemental Equilibrium, since Elemental Equilibrium will add fire resistance to the enemy, while the player is unable to utilize the cold and lightning weakness. One notable use case is when the player summons minions that primarily deal cold and lightning damage. Since minions do not inherit Elemental Equilibrium, the player&#39;s fire damage will permanently weaken the enemy to cold and lightning.
Location
Avatar of Fire is a standalone keystone located in the upper left edge of the skill tree right next to the Holy Fire burning cluster.

#### Chaos Inoculation
- **Implicit**: Maximum Life becomes 1, Immune to Chaos Damage | Minions deal (12—16)% increased Damage | Minions deal (12—16)% increased Damage | Minions deal (12—16)% increased Damage | Minions deal (12—16)% increased Damage
- **Mods**: Cannot be used with Chaos Inoculation | +(10—20) to Intelligence | Minions have (20—30)% increased Movement Speed | Minions deal (50—70)% increased Damage | +1 to maximum number of Raised Zombies | +1 to maximum number of Spectres | +1 to maximum number of Skeletons | Reserves 30% of Life | Minions have (40—50)% increased Movement Speed | +6 to maximum number of Raging Spirits | +3 to maximum number of Summoned Phantasms | increased maximum Life, reduced maximum Life, etc. apply to the life before CI is applied. Since this base life value is then overwritten by CI, the only advantage life modifiers provide to a CI character is the reduction on stun and status ailment.
Chaos Inoculation no longer grants immunity degeneration effect of Blood Rage while retaining other benefits of the skill as of 2.0.0 with the Blood Rage degeneration damage type changing to physical.
Low life conditions will never trigger while CI is enabled. Effects such as Pain Attunement and On Low Life mods on gear will not activate. For these effects, you must have 50% or less of your current maximum life. Chaos Inoculation sets your maximum life to 1.
Full life conditions will always trigger because you are always at 100% of 1 life.
Interaction with life reduction
Life reductions apply before CI which resets life to 1. For example from Ephemeral Edge.
Blood magic
When linked with Arrogance Support, affected skills cannot be cast, even if it is an aura which would drain a relative amount of mana/health.
Chaos resistance reduction/penetration
Since CI grants a flat-out immunity to chaos damage, effects that reduce or penetrate chaos resistance (i.e. Occultist&#39;s Void Beacon) have no effect against CI.
CI builds
It is generally best to wait until you have high energy shield before taking CI because it&#39;s much easier to survive on life at lower levels. Don&#39;t be afraid to take life passive skills for survivability while leveling up, since you can remove them later.
Characters with CI are usually more susceptible to stun and status ailments because of their low base life. Rather than taking otherwise useless life nodes as described above, Stun can be mitigated by increasing the Stun Recovery stat with items and passives or unique items such as Eye of Chayula, Skyforth, and Valyrium. Status ailments can be reduced with high elemental resistances, Elementalist&#39;s Elemancer perk with at least 3 golems, or unique items such as Auxium or Dream Fragments.
Chaos Inoculation works well with some other keystone passives, such as:

Ghost Reaver converts life gained from life leech into energy shield. Vaal Pact only disables any regeneration granted from passives that&#39;s converted by Zealot&#39;s Oath as of 3.0.0

Zealot&#39;s Oath applies life regeneration to energy shield. Regen effects that are based on maximum life become based on maximum ES. Note that &quot;regeneration&quot; does not include life flasks, as they are just &quot;Recovery&quot;.

Chaos Inoculation is located on the northeast edge of the skill tree.

The overall probability that an enemy will be ignited is:

It is worth noting that as opposed to chance to critical strike, which is checked once for each cast of the skill, the chance to ignite is checked separately for each individual hit. For example, a hit from Consecrated Path linked with Combustion that hits two enemies at once could potentially ignite one enemy, but not the other.
The  chance to Ignite from this gem will stack additively with  chance to Ignite modifiers from other sources, such as from the Ash, Frost and Storm notable passive skill, or the stat of Firestorm.
The normal rules for burning apply, linking this gem to a skill that deals no fire damage is pointless; unless the user is igniting enemies via cold damage skills with The Three Dragons or Hrimburn, or via lightning damage using Stormfire

Concentrated Effect Support

Efficacy Support

Increased Area of Effect Support

Arrogance Support (Supported Skills have (10-19)% increased Aura effect gem mod only; despite tooltip would not reflect it )

Void Manipulation Support

Swift Affliction Support

Less Duration Support (Supported Skills deal #% more Damage gem mod only; not affected by other mod of the gem)

Item Rarity Support

Item Quantity Support (currently unobtainable normally)


These gems depend on second active skill to gain buff that in turn benefit Death Aura skill:

Lifetap Support (the gem mod Supported Skills deal #% more Damage while you have Lifetap, as long as another active skill uses Lifetap Support and meets the cost requirements to gain the Lifetap buff, due to the mod Gain Lifetap after Spending a total of # Life with a Supported Skill)

Arcane Surge Support (the gem mod Supported Skills deal #% more Spell Damage while you have Arcane Surge, as long as another active skill uses Arcane Surge Support and meets the cost requirements to gain the Arcane Surge  buff (or other means to gain the buff), due to the mod Gain Arcane Surge after Spending a total of (15-400) Mana with Supported Skills)

This added damage is identical in function to other sources of added damage, such as Added Chaos Damage Support, and thus can be further increased by any of the applicable increases to the attacker&#39;s damage.

Cursed enemies have -x% to Chaos Resistance: The reduction to Chaos Resistance granted by this curse (after modifiers) stacks additively with the Occultist&#39;s Void Beacon Ascendancy passive and other similar effects.

Despair can be turned into an aura by linking it with either Blasphemy Support or Awakened Blasphemy Support.

Sequential Projectiles and Repeat: When linked to Barrage Support Elemental hit will pick one element per projectile shot; Multistrike Support will pick a new element for each repeat.

Damage conversion: Elemental Hit has added damage of each element present on the gem. This flat damage may be converted normally. The selection of an element happens afterwards and does not retroactively change the results of conversion. 

Example: If the player allocates the keystone Avatar of Fire, 50% of all lightning damage and 50% of all cold damage are converted to fire. This includes the flat damage inherently present on the gem. When Elemental Hit chooses fire, it will then deal significantly more damage than if the player did not have Avatar of Fire.


Dual Wielding: Elemental Hit will alternate weapons while dual wielding.

  3.15.0f
  
    Map Curse modifiers no longer have increased effect.

This was a restartless deploy of the patch so you will need to restart your client to receive the client changes, specifically the Map Curse modifier change requires a client restart to visually update descriptions.
  


  3.12.0
  
'' All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Items which apply a Curse to an enemy{{efn|name=Bex}} (such as the curse-on-hit Ring modifiers) no longer specify a level, and instead have a set magnitude for their values with a fixed amount of Doom, which is overwritten when another source applies a more potent version (similar to Arcane Surge).
    '''Elemental Weakness''': Curses applied by casting this spell now gain 10 Doom per second.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 1 is now 16 (was 24).

  2.0.0
  
    Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). It now grants 0.25% reduced elemental resistances on cursed enemies per 1% quality (was 0.4% per 1% quality). 
  


  1.2.0
  
    Now gains -8% Enemy Resistances at 20% quality, instead of -10% at 20% quality.

Skill Effect Duration, Buff Duration, and Warcry Duration will not affect the duration of the life regeneration effect or the endurance charges created with the skill.

Endurance Charge Duration modifiers will affect the duration of the endurance charges created with the skill.



Cooldown Recovery:

Cooldown Recovery and Warcry Cooldown Recovery will reduce the cooldown time of Enduring Cry.

This effectively increases the average life regeneration granted by the skill, assuming the skill is used on cooldown.




Warcry Speed:

Warcry Speed will shorten the animation speed of enduring cry.

Cast Speed and Attack Speed have no effect on warcry skills, as warcry skills are neither attacks nor spells.

Warcries can be cast instantly by allocating the Call to Arms keystone

  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Curses applied by casting '''Flammability''' skill now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now causes Hexed enemies to have 25% chance to be Ignited at all gem levels (from 10% at gem level 1, up to 14% at gem level 20).
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Resistance reduction increased by 5% at all levels. Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). Normalised the increased duration per gem level. Flammability now grants 0.5% increased burn duration on cursed enemies per 1% of quality (was 1% per 1% quality).
  


  0.9.13
  
    Flammability has been added to the game

    Curses applied by casting this spell now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now causes Hexed enemies to have 25% chance to be Frozen at all gem levels (from 10% at gem level 1, up to 14% at gem level 20).

#### Gem
- **Mods**: +2 to Level of Socketed Fire Gems and +2 to Level of Socketed Cold Gems modifiers via corruption, then socket a corrupted level 21 Elemental Hit gem in to the Frostferno item. This is now a level 29 Elemental Hit. Now support it with a corrupted level 4 Empower Support, increasing the Elemental Hit&#39;s level by 3 to bring it to level 32.
Quality
A Gemcutter&#39;s Prism can be used to upgrade a gem&#39;s quality. Adding quality to a gem will add an additional effect to the skill. The exact modifications quality gives to the gem are displayed in the detailed view (hover over the item and hold Alt).
The effect of quality scales with the base quality effect, however, only whole numbers will be granted (and thus the effect will always be rounded down); for example 3% quality on a gem with 0.5% effect will only grant 1% effect and not 1.5% effect. Effects that have some degree of fractions naturally are rounded to their natural bases (i.e. seconds will be rounded to milliseconds, etc.).
Gems with alternate quality effects can be found in  Grand Heist
s. They are prefaced as &quot;Anomalous&quot;, &quot;Divergent&quot;, or &quot;Phantasmal&quot; instead of &quot;Superior&quot;.
Corruption
Like most items, gems can be Corrupted using a Vaal Orb. Corruption on gems can potentially lift the level or quality percentage of a gem above the maximum of 20. Corruption can also convert a gem into its  Vaal skill
 equivalent, if one exists. It&#39;s suggested that you apply Corruption to a Skill Gem when the Skill gem is at level 20, 20% quality or both in order for corruption to potentially exceed the cap.
After the release of  Incursion league
, it became possible to achieve &quot;double-corruption&quot; of a gem by using the Lapidary Lens device in The Temple of Atzoatl. The device corrupts a skill or a support gem twice, which makes possible to apply two different effects of corruption at once. This allows to receive a level 21 gem with 23% quality.

#### Herald of the Hive
- **Description**: Grants a buff which causes you to deal more damage for each Herald skill affecting you. While you have this buff, this skill turns the space around you into a tear in reality, releasing pulses that damage enemies around you. Inflicting Ailments causes you to gain Otherworldly Pressure, which increases the frequency of the pulses. You will lose Otherworldly Pressure over time, at a rate which increases the more of it you have. The damage inflicted by this skill is not affected by modifiers to spell damage.

Quality: Herald of Thunder&#39;s increased lightning damage quality bonus is global, meaning that it affects the character&#39;s lightning damage from all sources, not only Herald of Thunder.

Cannot Apply Shock: Herald of Thunder&#39;s on-kill effect cannot apply Shock. However, if The Three Dragons is equipped, the storm can apply Freeze.

Calculations of the efficiency
Assuming the player allocates the Chaos Inoculation keystone, the &quot;value&quot; of this effect is as follows for various maximum elemental resistance breakpoints. (The &quot;Damage Taken&quot; is an arbitrary amount corresponding to a large elemental hit for the purposes of calculation and percentages are rounded up or down to conform to the way the game displays resistances (whole numbers)).

Delay time is skill effect duration and is affected by skill effect duration stats including skill gem&#39;s one. Base time for delay is calculated as a time needed for character to normally run the euclidean distance between position where the spell was cast and exit position with character&#39;s current movement speed. Because of that movement speed stats (including conditional ones, auras, etc) also affects delay time. It is not possible to completely eliminate this delay because there is a hidden 0.1 second delay added to it.

Sequence of operations: The lightning explosion occurs before the caster leaves and after the caster arrives. This will, for example, cause the caster to take damage from monsters that explode on death that are killed by Lightning Warp.

Death: If the caster dies before the teleport executes, the teleport will still execute, transporting the caster&#39;s corpse to the targeted location.

Can be used in left mouse button slot to cast and move.


Strategy
Movement
Lightning Warp is primarily used as a movement skill. To improve Lightning Warp&#39;s effectiveness as a movement skill, one should support it with Less Duration Support, Faster Casting Support, and Swift Affliction Support. If only one support gem can be used, [[
Less Duration Support]] will generally result in faster travel. Taking increased Skill Effect Duration passives will render Lightning Warp much less useful as a movement skill, in which case you may want to consider alternatives such as Flame Dash, Leap Slam, Whirling Blades.
Compared with Leap Slam, Lightning Warp has the advantages of not requiring any particular weapon, potentially higher speed, and slightly longer range. However, it costs more mana and requires three support gems to be fully effective. Compared with Flame Dash, Lightning Warp has the advantage of being able to be cast as many times as possible, but costs slightly more mana and has a noticeable delay.
With Arctic Armour
Lightning Warp can be used as a method of travel when using Arctic Armour, since this will allow the player to always remain stationary and thus always receive Arctic Armour&#39;s less Damage taken while stationary bonus.

Types of modifiers
Implicit modifiers
Implicit modifiersalways spawn on entities before the addition or change of additional modifiers (for example by changing the rarity).
On monsters, implicit modifiers can be very commonly found. For example, some monsters are granted damage conversion which converts their inherent damage to that of another element. However, on unique monsters and bosses implicits are most notable - for example most bosses are granted a boost to their item rarity and item quantity as well as other bonuses such as on Atziri.
On items, visible implicit modifiers are most commonly found on:

Rings
Amulets
Belts
Quivers
Most weapons
Shields
Specific Body Armours (Astral Plate, Assassin&#39;s Garb, Occultist&#39;s Vestment, and Carnal Armour.)

Shields and body armour also commonly have a hidden movement speed penalty modifier.
Unlike the implicit modifiers on monsters, the implicit modifiers on equipment can be by altered in various ways:

Blessed Orb - rerolls the range of the stats found on the implicit modifiers.
Vaal Orb- Corruption can add or replace an implicit modifier depending on the item type.
Using a Resonator with a Gilded Fossilwill add an Item sells for much more to vendors implicit to the item. This does not overwrite or affect the item&#39;s current implicit modifier.
Certain Harvest crafting options allows you to set a new implicit modifier on jewels.

Certain unique items also have special interactions with implicits:

Greatwolf Talisman- has two randomly chosen talisman implicits.

Enchantments
Enchantments are similar to implicit modifiers, but are granted to the item by specific means. Enchantments have their own mod slot on items and do not use the implicit mod slot. Most items can have up to one enchantment at a time. Any level of rarity, even unique items, can be enchanted. Mirrored or corrupted items cannot receive an enchantment. They are always fixed values, so 
Blessed Orbs
 have no effect on them. Applying an enchantment on an already enchanted item replaces the old enchantment with the new one. This does not include maps, they can only be enchanted once.

Using an Instilling Orb on a flask adds an enchantment which causes the flask to be automatically used when a certain condition is met.
Labyrinth Enchantments are obtained from the Divine Font at the end of the Labyrinth. Gloves, Boots, and Helmets can receive Labyrinth enchantments. Belts could also be given enchantments in the Eternal Labyrinth of Potential.
Rings, Amulets, and certain Blight league uniques can be Anointed with Oils to give it an enchantment.
 Cluster Jewel
s have two (for legacy bases) or three enchantments: One that determines what stat the small passives gives (which determine what mods the jewel can roll), one that determines how many passive skills are in the cluster, and one that determines how many jewel sockets it has (for Large and Medium Cluster Jewels).
Certain Harvest crafting options allows you to add enchantments to weapons, body armours, maps and flasks. Read Wild Brambleback Bulb, Primal Cystcaller Bulb, Vivid Nestback Grain and Vivid Striketail Grain for details.
Weapons and body armour with enchantments are possible rewards in Grand Heists. The enchantments can be added by using Tailoring Orb or Tempering Orb which drops from  Heist league
.
Jewels with enchantments can be found in Heists. The enchantment modifiers pool apparently the same as Harvest jewel implicit.

Explicit modifiers
Explicit modifiers are generally dynamically generated by changing the rarity of the entity or by other modification.
The number of affixes given by rarity depends on the rarity class:

Magic- random modifiers based on conditions: (0 to 1) prefix and (0 to 1) suffix
Rare - random modifiers based on conditions: (1 to 3) prefixes and (1 to 3) suffixes (but always at least 3) with the exception of jewels which can only have (1 to 2) prefixes and (1 to 2) suffixes
Unique- non-random, fixed modifiers based on the unique entity

Monsters have additional means of receiving modifiers:

Magicpacks of monsters may receive a Bloodlines modifier
Raremonsters may receive a Nemesis modifier
Normaland Magicmonsters may be touched by a Tormented Spirit, giving a Torment &#39;Touch&#39; modifier
Rareand Uniquemonsters may be possessed by a Tormented Spirit, giving a Torment &#39;Possession&#39; modifier
Picking up a Talisman gives monsters a Talisman modifier
RareBeasts, which are found in Einhar missions, can have one or two Bestiary mods.

On items, modifiers can be changed by spending currency:

Divine Orb rerolls the value of any stats on explicit modifiers on the item
Orb of Scouring, Orb of Transmutation, Orb of Alchemy, Orb of Chance, Regal Orb, and Ancient Orb may be used to alter the rarity of an item (adding/removing mods in the process)
Orb of Horizons and Harbinger&#39;s Orb will give the newly created map different modifiers.


Orb of Alteration and Chaos Orb may be used to re-roll the modifiers on Magic and Rare items respectively
Orb of Augmentation and Exalted Orb may be used to add a random modifier on Magic and Rare items respectively
Vaal Orb has a chance to change the rarity or create maps with 8 Modifiers
Orb of Annulment removes a random modifier from an item

Areas may receive modifiers depending on how they were created unlike items, monsters or strongboxes:

Corrupted areas as they have the &#39;secret_area&#39; tag will receive (0 to 1) prefixes and (0 to 1) suffixes that satisfy that tag
Areas created with Map items receive the modifiers on the map they were created with
Areas created through a Map device may receive mods from placing map fragments in the device
The current league(s) or other server-wide effects (from races for example)
With Tempest active in the area, the area may receive a tempest modifier

Conditions
Modifiers usually include conditions which are used to determine how they appear. These are generally used to govern the creation of explicit modifiers on entities.

Mod Level
The required level of the relevant entity. For example, this can be the required item level or a monster level.
However, there are cases where this is not respected: in particular this is the case for any mods that are directly given to other entities, such as implicit mods including enchantments or monsters with innate mods.
The mod level is also a factor in calculating the level requirement of items; raising the level requirement up to 80% requirement of the mod (with the requirement rounded down to the nearest whole integer). In particular this is the case for mods on unique items and for enchantments
For example, Seven-League Step normally has a level requirement of 1, however putting the 0.5% of Damage Leeched as Life if you&#39;ve Killed Recently enchantment from the 3rd labyrinth on it, will increase the level requirement to .
Mod Group
Mods have a single group associated with them. Only one mod from a group can appear at a time, as such all mods in specific group are mutually exclusive.
This system is used to group various types of modifiers together and to prevent the same modifiers to appear on items.
For example, on items this is used a lot for the prefix and suffix generation to create those group of modifiers that modify only a single or two stats. Together with the item level requirements, this creates the &quot;tiered&quot; system of modifiers.
This system was called &quot;mod family&quot; by the GGG, but has been referred to as mod group by the community.
Tags
Mods use the internal Tag system to determine on which entities they can appear and how likely they are to appear on entities. Tags are classified as spawn weight tag and mod tag:
Spawn weight tag
Spawn weight tag primarily functions like this:

Find the Tags on the basetype.
Match the Tags against the mod&#39;s list of tags.
For the found mods get the associated spawn weighting of the tag.
If the spawn weighting is zero, discard the mod, otherwise use it.
If multiple tags apply, the left-most tags are most important, where the right most tags are the least.

So, for example:

Glorious Plate has the tags str_armour • body_armour • armour • default.
Assassin&#39;s Garb has the tags dex_armour • body_armour • armour • default.
The mod Impregnable has the spawn weights str_armour 1000、 default 0.
Result for Glorious Plate: The mod can spawn because it has the tag str_armour and a positive spawn weight.
Result for Assassin&#39;s Garb: The mod can not spawn because only default matches and its spawn weight is 0.

Mod tag
Mods are tagged with mod tag such as &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;caster&quot;, &quot;elemental&quot;, &quot;damage&quot;, &quot;curse&quot;, &quot;gem&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;lightning&quot; etc. Some mod did not have any tag. Those tag can interact with Catalyst and Fossil, , Harvest crafting and several enchantments.
Currency such as Exalted Orb, as well as beastcrafting recipes &quot;add affix, remove affix&quot;, interact with item which has metamod of Spellcraft - Cannot roll Attack Modifiers (Suffix) or of Weaponcraft - Cannot roll Caster Modifiers (Suffix). Which Exalted Orb would not add mod to the item with attack mod tag (of Spellcraft) or caster mod tag (of Weaponcraft). However, essence, Awakener&#39;s Orb ignore aforementioned metamod.
The Catalyst will increase the value of mod that matching the catalyst used. For example, Imbued Catalyst will add quality to the item which the quality will increase the numeric value of caster mod. It also increase the likelihood to add caster mod to the item if using the currency, and consume the quality depends on which currency is used.
Fossil multiply the spawn weight of mod that matching the fossil, For example, Corroded Fossil multiply the spawn weight of mod that have &quot;physical and Ailment&quot; or &quot;Chaos and Ailment&quot; tags by 10, and multiply the spawn weight of the mod with &quot;elemental&quot; tag by 0.
Some enchantments, such as (5–8)% increased maximum Life on body armor, will affect the mod with &quot;life&quot; mod tag.

Increased Rarity of Items found and Increased Quantity of Items found modifiers can only benefit the character. These bonuses will be rendered useless when transferred to minions.
Bonuses not from modifiers on the equipped shield are not removed from the character and transferred to minions. Skill gems socketed in equipped shields will still be usable. The buff from Tempest Shield will still benefit the character.
Location
Necromantic Aegis is located in the centre of the tree, to the right of the Scion&#39;s starting area. The keystone shared the same small passive node that connects to Decay Ward cluster.

Mechanics
The effects of Onslaught are affected by increased Buff Effect, which can only be obtained through the use of Ichimonji or Onslaught specific sources like Daresso&#39;s Defiance or the  Avatar of the Chase
 Raider ascendancy. The duration of Onslaught cannot be increased by the duration passive nodes because these only increase the duration of buffs applied by skills.
Note that permanent Onslaught from passive skill (and other similar source such as item mod ), would not have a buff status icon. Only temporary Onslaught buff (other than flask) would have a buff status icon.

Some pseudo-instant skills, such as Dash and Flame Dash, will also benefit from the  +1 Cooldown Use.
Although instant skills such as Frostblink cannot have  +1 Cooldown Use, instant skills can still be supported by Second Wind and have  (24-5)% reduced Cooldown Recovery Rate (for gem level 1-20), as well as the mod from Divergent alternative gem quality:  Regenerate 0.05% of Life over 1 second when you use Supported Skills (per 1% quality). Note that reduced Cooldown Recovery Rate is a bad mod (as part of the 3.15 gem nerf), unless player stack the gem level of this support to &gt;26, which that mod start to become  #% increased Cooldown Recovery Rate. Read Cooldown article for the full formula for the Cooldown Recovery Rate. Since it is impractical to stack to that gem level, it is not recommended to use this support gem for instant skill, unless player want to use the Divergent alternative quality to support the instant skill.

Version history
VersionChanges

  3.19.0
  
    The damage and life scaling values for minions have been adjusted. Generally speaking, minion life and damage is unchanged in the very early game, roughly 30% lower in mid acts, roughly 20% lower at level 20 of the minion skill, and roughly 10% lower at level 30 of the minion skill.
    Summon Raging Spirit no longer has Minions gain 15% less Added Damage. 
    Now has Minions deal 0% more Damage at gem level 1, up to 38% more Damage at gem level 20 (previously 0%). 
    Minion base life is now 20% higher at all levels. 
    Now costs 4 mana at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 16 at gem level 20 (previously 12). 
    The Helmet Enchantments that grant a chance to summon an extra Minion now grant a 16% chance from the Merciless Labyrinth (previously 12%) and a 24% chance from the Eternal Labyrinth (previously 18%). 
  


  3.16.0
  
    Summoned Raging Spirits now convert all of their Damage to Fire Damage.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 16 (was 12).
    Raging Spirits, Raised Zombies, 'of the Grave' enchantment minions, and Spectral Spirits (from Essence of Insanity on a weapon) now have 100% more base accuracy rating than previously. Raging Spirits mana cost changes have been undone.
  


  3.1.0
  
    Summon Raging Spirit now have a 15% less Added Damage multiplier, up from 30%.
    Raging Spirits, Spiders created from Arakaali's Fang, and the spirit skulls from the Essence of Insanity can no longer taunt their enemies.
  


  2.5.0
  
    Reduced the maximum number of Summoned Raging Spirits to 20, but we have also increased damage as the gem levels up to compensate. It's intended to be a similar damage output but with less casting needed and less effective area of effect.
    Totems and all other minions now have 40% elemental resistance and 20% chaos resistance. This also includes minions that didn't have resistances previously, like wolves.
  


  2.1.0
  
    Summon Raging Spirit's duration has been increased from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds. The mana cost has been reduced from 6 to 5 at level one and reduced from 15 to 12 at level 20. The cast speed has been reduced to 500ms from 800ms. The damage dealt by Raging Spirits has been substantially reworked and is lower at high levels.

    Fixed a bug introduced in 3.12 where applying Temporal Chains in a way not from a Curse Skill, such as through Curse on Hit modifiers, was incorrectly applying Temporal Chains' 50% less effect on Players to all targets.
    Labyrinth Helmet Enchantments that provide increased Effect to a specific Hex now have values of 10% for the Merciless Enchantments (previously 20%), and 15% for the Eternal Enchantments (previously 30%).
  


  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Items which apply a Curse to an enemy (such as the curse-on-hit Ring modifiers) no longer specify a level, and instead have a set magnitude for their values with a fixed amount of Doom, which is overwritten when another source applies a more potent version (similar to Arcane Surge).
    Curses applied by casting Temporal Chains now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now gains additional radius as the gem levels, up to +10 at gem level 20 (from +7).
    Now gains 1% increased effect of Curse per 2% gem quality (previously caused normal and magic enemies to have 1% less action speed per 2% gem quality).
    Now offered Witch, Shadow and Scion for completing {{ql|Lost in Love}}, and can be purchased from Clarissa by the Ranger.
    Now has alternative gem quality.
  


  3.10.0
  
    Now has 50% less effect against players. Previously, it had 40% reduced effect against players. Note that this change means it is multiplicative with sources of increased curse effect.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 1 is now 16 (was 24).
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 33 (was 50).
    Now causes Normal and Magic enemies to have 20% less Action Speed at gem level 1, up to 29% less Action Speed at gem level 20.
    Now causes Rare and Unique enemies to have 10% less Action Speed at gem level 1, up to 14% less Action Speed at gem level 20.
  


  3.5.0
  
    The total amount that you can slow the expiration of an effect on a character through a time-slowing mechanism (such as Temporal Chains) is now capped at 75% from all sources.
  


  3.3.0
  
    Added new corrupted implicits which can appear on items corrupted by Vaal Orb, bringing the total to approximately 176. Many of the old implicits were buffed or moved to different items, and some were disabled. Generally, corrupted implicits are now more powerful on average.
    (Not in patch note) Temporal Chains Skill granted from boots corrupted implicit, is spawn disabled.
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Temporal Chains, Enfeeble, Curse on Hit and Blasphemy have had their quality bonuses returned to normal.
    A cap of 75% now applies to the action speed reduction caused by Temporal Chains.
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Temporal Chains quality now grants 0.5% increased Cast Speed per point of quality instead of slowing enemies by 0.5% per point of quality.
  


  2.0.2
  
    Temporal Chains' slowing effect now applies multiplicatively with Chill's slowing effect. This will result in less of an impact when both are used on the same target.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). Duration increases per level slightly modified. The end result is slightly longer duration at level 1 but slightly shorter duration at level 20.
  


  0.10.0
  
    Fixed a bug where chilling monsters or cursing them with Temporal Chains could  /  prevent their attacks from succeeding.
  


  0.9.13
  
    Reduced the effect of Temporal Chains, due to being overpowered in both PvE and PvP.  /  This also affects the version that Maps inflict on you

#### The Perfect Form
- **Requires**: Requires Level 65, 197 Dex
- **Mods**: +50% chance to Suppress Spell Damage | (150—200)% increased Evasion Rating | -30% to Cold Resistance | Evasion Rating is increased by Overcapped Cold Resistance | Acrobatics | (Overcapped Resistance is the amount by whch Uncapped Resistance is higher than Maximum Resistance) | (Uncapped Resistance is the value Resistance would have if ignoring Maximum Resistance) | (Modifiers to Chance to Suppress Spell Damage instead apply to Chance to Dodge Spell Hits at 50% of their value. Maximum Chance to Dodge Spell Hits is 75%) | (40% of Damage from Suppressed Hits and Ailments they inflict is prevented) | Phase Acrobatics mod has the same effect as the Phase Acrobatics keystone. Taking the keystone in addition to equipping this item will impart no additional benefit.
The definition for the phrase &quot;Evasion Rating is increased by Uncapped Cold Resistance&quot; is translated ingame as: &quot;Uncapped Restistance is the Value Resistance would have if ignoring Maximum Resistance&quot;, which means you get increased evasion rating for the value that you see behind your current maximum resistance ingame.
&quot;Cold Resistance:75%(150%)&quot;.

#### The Sorrow of the Divine
- **Requires**: Requires Level 35
- **Implicit**: Creates Consecrated Ground on Use
- **Mods**: Life Recovery from Flasks also applies to Energy Shield during Effect | (25—50)% increased Duration | Zealot's Oath during Effect | (Life Regeneration is applied to Energy Shield instead.) | (Life flask effects are still removed when unreserved life is filled) | Life Recovery from Flasks also Applies to Energy Shield&quot; effect is limited, as a non-instant Life Flask can&#39;t currently be used while at full Life. &quot;Seething&quot;-prefix and other instant Life Flasks can be used to instantly recover small amounts of Energy Shield however; this can be used to quickly hit Max ES for the purposes of activating Mahuxotl&#39;s Machination&#39;s Everlasting Sacrifice Keystone.

The Timeless Jewel-enabled Corrupted Soul Keystone spreads damage between Life and Energy Shield, which can maximize the effectiveness of this flask.

If The Sorrow of the Divine is used in conjunction with Blood of the Karui and the character stays below full Life until the Blood of the Karui flask duration ends, the character will recover their maximum Life total as Energy Shield (not their maximum Energy Shield).

Indigon&#39;s &quot;Non-instant Mana Recovery from Flasks is also Recovered as Life&quot; effect does NOT interact with this item to recover Energy Shield.

Hybrid Life / Energy Shield builds, such as one using Geofri&#39;s Sanctuary, can exploit The Sorrow of the Divine in conjunction with Forbidden Taste. For example, if a character has 3000 Life, 12000 Energy Shield, and two Forbidden Taste with perfect rolls, they could use each flask twice, gaining 3000 Life instantly as Energy Shield four times within the effect of The Sorrow of the Divine to bring their Energy Shield from 0 to 12000. This is one of the few ways in the game to instantly restore such a large amount of Energy Shield. Chaos Inoculation builds are unable to use this synergy as their maximum Life is 1.
