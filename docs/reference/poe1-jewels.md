#### Gem
- **Mods**: +2 to Level of Socketed Fire Gems and +2 to Level of Socketed Cold Gems modifiers via corruption, then socket a corrupted level 21 Elemental Hit gem in to the Frostferno item. This is now a level 29 Elemental Hit. Now support it with a corrupted level 4 Empower Support, increasing the Elemental Hit&#39;s level by 3 to bring it to level 32.
Quality
A Gemcutter&#39;s Prism can be used to upgrade a gem&#39;s quality. Adding quality to a gem will add an additional effect to the skill. The exact modifications quality gives to the gem are displayed in the detailed view (hover over the item and hold Alt).
The effect of quality scales with the base quality effect, however, only whole numbers will be granted (and thus the effect will always be rounded down); for example 3% quality on a gem with 0.5% effect will only grant 1% effect and not 1.5% effect. Effects that have some degree of fractions naturally are rounded to their natural bases (i.e. seconds will be rounded to milliseconds, etc.).
Gems with alternate quality effects can be found in  Grand Heist
s. They are prefaced as &quot;Anomalous&quot;, &quot;Divergent&quot;, or &quot;Phantasmal&quot; instead of &quot;Superior&quot;.
Corruption
Like most items, gems can be Corrupted using a Vaal Orb. Corruption on gems can potentially lift the level or quality percentage of a gem above the maximum of 20. Corruption can also convert a gem into its  Vaal skill
 equivalent, if one exists. It&#39;s suggested that you apply Corruption to a Skill Gem when the Skill gem is at level 20, 20% quality or both in order for corruption to potentially exceed the cap.
After the release of  Incursion league
, it became possible to achieve &quot;double-corruption&quot; of a gem by using the Lapidary Lens device in The Temple of Atzoatl. The device corrupts a skill or a support gem twice, which makes possible to apply two different effects of corruption at once. This allows to receive a level 21 gem with 23% quality.

Types of modifiers
Implicit modifiers
Implicit modifiersalways spawn on entities before the addition or change of additional modifiers (for example by changing the rarity).
On monsters, implicit modifiers can be very commonly found. For example, some monsters are granted damage conversion which converts their inherent damage to that of another element. However, on unique monsters and bosses implicits are most notable - for example most bosses are granted a boost to their item rarity and item quantity as well as other bonuses such as on Atziri.
On items, visible implicit modifiers are most commonly found on:

Rings
Amulets
Belts
Quivers
Most weapons
Shields
Specific Body Armours (Astral Plate, Assassin&#39;s Garb, Occultist&#39;s Vestment, and Carnal Armour.)

Shields and body armour also commonly have a hidden movement speed penalty modifier.
Unlike the implicit modifiers on monsters, the implicit modifiers on equipment can be by altered in various ways:

Blessed Orb - rerolls the range of the stats found on the implicit modifiers.
Vaal Orb- Corruption can add or replace an implicit modifier depending on the item type.
Using a Resonator with a Gilded Fossilwill add an Item sells for much more to vendors implicit to the item. This does not overwrite or affect the item&#39;s current implicit modifier.
Certain Harvest crafting options allows you to set a new implicit modifier on jewels.

Certain unique items also have special interactions with implicits:

Greatwolf Talisman- has two randomly chosen talisman implicits.

Enchantments
Enchantments are similar to implicit modifiers, but are granted to the item by specific means. Enchantments have their own mod slot on items and do not use the implicit mod slot. Most items can have up to one enchantment at a time. Any level of rarity, even unique items, can be enchanted. Mirrored or corrupted items cannot receive an enchantment. They are always fixed values, so 
Blessed Orbs
 have no effect on them. Applying an enchantment on an already enchanted item replaces the old enchantment with the new one. This does not include maps, they can only be enchanted once.

Using an Instilling Orb on a flask adds an enchantment which causes the flask to be automatically used when a certain condition is met.
Labyrinth Enchantments are obtained from the Divine Font at the end of the Labyrinth. Gloves, Boots, and Helmets can receive Labyrinth enchantments. Belts could also be given enchantments in the Eternal Labyrinth of Potential.
Rings, Amulets, and certain Blight league uniques can be Anointed with Oils to give it an enchantment.
 Cluster Jewel
s have two (for legacy bases) or three enchantments: One that determines what stat the small passives gives (which determine what mods the jewel can roll), one that determines how many passive skills are in the cluster, and one that determines how many jewel sockets it has (for Large and Medium Cluster Jewels).
Certain Harvest crafting options allows you to add enchantments to weapons, body armours, maps and flasks. Read Wild Brambleback Bulb, Primal Cystcaller Bulb, Vivid Nestback Grain and Vivid Striketail Grain for details.
Weapons and body armour with enchantments are possible rewards in Grand Heists. The enchantments can be added by using Tailoring Orb or Tempering Orb which drops from  Heist league
.
Jewels with enchantments can be found in Heists. The enchantment modifiers pool apparently the same as Harvest jewel implicit.

Explicit modifiers
Explicit modifiers are generally dynamically generated by changing the rarity of the entity or by other modification.
The number of affixes given by rarity depends on the rarity class:

Magic- random modifiers based on conditions: (0 to 1) prefix and (0 to 1) suffix
Rare - random modifiers based on conditions: (1 to 3) prefixes and (1 to 3) suffixes (but always at least 3) with the exception of jewels which can only have (1 to 2) prefixes and (1 to 2) suffixes
Unique- non-random, fixed modifiers based on the unique entity

Monsters have additional means of receiving modifiers:

Magicpacks of monsters may receive a Bloodlines modifier
Raremonsters may receive a Nemesis modifier
Normaland Magicmonsters may be touched by a Tormented Spirit, giving a Torment &#39;Touch&#39; modifier
Rareand Uniquemonsters may be possessed by a Tormented Spirit, giving a Torment &#39;Possession&#39; modifier
Picking up a Talisman gives monsters a Talisman modifier
RareBeasts, which are found in Einhar missions, can have one or two Bestiary mods.

On items, modifiers can be changed by spending currency:

Divine Orb rerolls the value of any stats on explicit modifiers on the item
Orb of Scouring, Orb of Transmutation, Orb of Alchemy, Orb of Chance, Regal Orb, and Ancient Orb may be used to alter the rarity of an item (adding/removing mods in the process)
Orb of Horizons and Harbinger&#39;s Orb will give the newly created map different modifiers.


Orb of Alteration and Chaos Orb may be used to re-roll the modifiers on Magic and Rare items respectively
Orb of Augmentation and Exalted Orb may be used to add a random modifier on Magic and Rare items respectively
Vaal Orb has a chance to change the rarity or create maps with 8 Modifiers
Orb of Annulment removes a random modifier from an item

Areas may receive modifiers depending on how they were created unlike items, monsters or strongboxes:

Corrupted areas as they have the &#39;secret_area&#39; tag will receive (0 to 1) prefixes and (0 to 1) suffixes that satisfy that tag
Areas created with Map items receive the modifiers on the map they were created with
Areas created through a Map device may receive mods from placing map fragments in the device
The current league(s) or other server-wide effects (from races for example)
With Tempest active in the area, the area may receive a tempest modifier

Conditions
Modifiers usually include conditions which are used to determine how they appear. These are generally used to govern the creation of explicit modifiers on entities.
Mod Domain
The mod generation determines what entity the mod applies to. The domains are primarily reverse engineered, as detailed information has been removed from the game files.

Mod Level
The required level of the relevant entity. For example, this can be the required item level or a monster level.
However, there are cases where this is not respected: in particular this is the case for any mods that are directly given to other entities, such as implicit mods including enchantments or monsters with innate mods.
The mod level is also a factor in calculating the level requirement of items; raising the level requirement up to 80% requirement of the mod (with the requirement rounded down to the nearest whole integer). In particular this is the case for mods on unique items and for enchantments
For example, Seven-League Step normally has a level requirement of 1, however putting the 0.5% of Damage Leeched as Life if you&#39;ve Killed Recently enchantment from the 3rd labyrinth on it, will increase the level requirement to .
Mod Group
Mods have a single group associated with them. Only one mod from a group can appear at a time, as such all mods in specific group are mutually exclusive.
This system is used to group various types of modifiers together and to prevent the same modifiers to appear on items.
For example, on items this is used a lot for the prefix and suffix generation to create those group of modifiers that modify only a single or two stats. Together with the item level requirements, this creates the &quot;tiered&quot; system of modifiers.
This system was called &quot;mod family&quot; by the GGG, but has been referred to as mod group by the community.
Tags
Mods use the internal Tag system to determine on which entities they can appear and how likely they are to appear on entities. Tags are classified as spawn weight tag and mod tag:
Spawn weight tag
Spawn weight tag primarily functions like this:

Find the Tags on the basetype.
Match the Tags against the mod&#39;s list of tags.
For the found mods get the associated spawn weighting of the tag.
If the spawn weighting is zero, discard the mod, otherwise use it.
If multiple tags apply, the left-most tags are most important, where the right most tags are the least.

So, for example:

Glorious Plate has the tags str_armour • body_armour • armour • default.
Assassin&#39;s Garb has the tags dex_armour • body_armour • armour • default.
The mod Impregnable has the spawn weights str_armour 1000、 default 0.
Result for Glorious Plate: The mod can spawn because it has the tag str_armour and a positive spawn weight.
Result for Assassin&#39;s Garb: The mod can not spawn because only default matches and its spawn weight is 0.

Mod tag
Mods are tagged with mod tag such as &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;caster&quot;, &quot;elemental&quot;, &quot;damage&quot;, &quot;curse&quot;, &quot;gem&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;lightning&quot; etc. Some mod did not have any tag. Those tag can interact with Catalyst and Fossil, , Harvest crafting and several enchantments.
Currency such as Exalted Orb, as well as beastcrafting recipes &quot;add affix, remove affix&quot;, interact with item which has metamod of Spellcraft - Cannot roll Attack Modifiers (Suffix) or of Weaponcraft - Cannot roll Caster Modifiers (Suffix). Which Exalted Orb would not add mod to the item with attack mod tag (of Spellcraft) or caster mod tag (of Weaponcraft). However, essence, Awakener&#39;s Orb ignore aforementioned metamod.
The Catalyst will increase the value of mod that matching the catalyst used. For example, Imbued Catalyst will add quality to the item which the quality will increase the numeric value of caster mod. It also increase the likelihood to add caster mod to the item if using the currency, and consume the quality depends on which currency is used.
Fossil multiply the spawn weight of mod that matching the fossil, For example, Corroded Fossil multiply the spawn weight of mod that have &quot;physical and Ailment&quot; or &quot;Chaos and Ailment&quot; tags by 10, and multiply the spawn weight of the mod with &quot;elemental&quot; tag by 0.
Some enchantments, such as (5–8)% increased maximum Life on body armor, will affect the mod with &quot;life&quot; mod tag.
