Unique items can also be used, giving guardians powerful abilities not found elsewhere in the game. Be careful when using valuable items—anything you give to your guardian is gone forever.
The Guardian uses weapons and shields in the same way as player characters, and can dual wield if two one-handed weapons are animated. If you animate an item type that the Guardian is already using (such as a helmet), the new item will overwrite the old one. Equipping an armour piece restores 25% of its life; equipping one-handed weapons or shields will alternate between left and right hand. You cannot equip two shields.
The Guardian does not share your max amount of curses you can apply to enemies, and therefore functions as a player with the default curse limit when applying curses (through corrupted gloves, for example).
Items: The Guardian&#39;s items are tied to the character that summoned it, rather than the gem itself. Equipping a level 1 version of the gem will disable any items the Guardian cannot equip, which will be present again once a high enough level gem is equipped.
Items deleted on Death: When a Guardian dies, all its equipment is deleted and cannot be recovered. This makes very risky to use powerful or valuable items on an Animated Guardian. It is possible to prevent a body armour worn by a Guardian from being deleted upon Guardian death by crafting the Equipped Animated Guardian drops item on death mod onto it. Note once more that equipment will not be lost upon de-spawning, only death.
Necromantic Aegis: While using Necromantic Aegis your Guardian benefits from its own shield as well as the one you have equipped, allowing it to gain the benefit of two shields at once. Some unique shields can be quite powerful when doubled up this way. If your Guardian is equipped with a two-handed weapon, it will not benefit from your shield.
Player versus Player: Animated Guardians killed in PvP areas will not lose their items. This does not apply to Hall of Grandmasters, even though the map says &quot;PvP damage scaling in effect&quot;. In fact, not only is it possible to lose the Guardian&#39;s items here, but death is very likely because of the way PvP damage scaling works. Minor enemies can instantly kill a Guardian with 50000+ life in this map, so it is highly recommended to despawn your Guardian before attempting.
Item-Granted Skills: Animated guardians cannot use skills granted by items. Equipping items like Death&#39;s Oath, The Rippling Thoughts, or Bubonic Trail will not allow the Guardian to use their associated triggered skills. Fire Burst granted by Essence of Hysteria, even though having no &quot;trigger&quot; or &quot;granted&quot; in its modifier discription, won&#39;t work either. The Guardian is not your party member, and will not be able to use abilities like the one found on Ambu&#39;s Charge. Effects that apply to nearby allies or enemies, like Leer Cast, Victario&#39;s Flight, or Dying Breath, will apply as normal.
Abyssal Sockets: Animate guardians cannot benefit from abyss jewel modifiers. Equipping items like Tombfist or Bubonic Trail with abyss jewel(s) socketed will not grant their modifiers to animate guardian.
Notable items
Life regeneration and percentage increases to life are especially potent on an Animate Guardian because of its huge innate life pool.
The stats displayed in the skills tooltip only accounts for modifiers the skill has, like from the passive tree, jewels, player-equipped items and support gems. It cannot account for further modifiers from things like being affected by an aura, shields through Necromantic Aegis or modifiers from items the AG has equipped. These will not factor into the skills tooltip but are active nonetheless.
Helmet:

Ylfeban&#39;s Trickery - Chance to curse enemies on hit. The triggered skill to create Shocked Ground won&#39;t trigger.
Leer Cast - Aura that grants increased damage.
Mask of the Stitched Demon - Massive life regeneration if the AG gets lots of energy shield from other sources like Grave Intentions and Gravicius&#39;s signature craft for body armour.
Mask of the Tribunal - Various bonuses depending on the attributes provided to the Animate Guardian from other equipped items or The Baron.
Crown of the Tyrant - Huge amount of life for your AG, reduce all elemental resistances of nearby enemies and increase global Fire/Cold/Lightning/Chaos damage to nearby allies.
An influenced helmet with Nearby Enemies take 9% increased &lt;Physical/Elemental&gt; Damage or Nearby Enemies have -9% to &lt;Fire/Cold/Lightning&gt; Resistance. Note that these mods also reduce the defenses of the AG.

Body Armour:

Gruthkul&#39;s Pelt - Life, life regeneration and cold resistance.
Blunderbore - Two Shrines effects on animate Guardian. Free knockback aoe &amp; dmg.
Belly of the Beast - Massive percentage increase to life and resistances.
Zahndethus&#39; Cassock - Creates Consecrated Ground when the AG blocks and chaos resistance.
Ambu&#39;s Charge - Life regeneration if the Animate Guardian has been hit recently, life and resistances. The AG has no party members, so it will not share Endurance Charges.
Garb of the Ephemeral - Cannot be slowed and nearby enemies cannot crit.

Gloves:

Southbound - Percentage increase to life and cold resistance. Note that the AG can no longer kill non-frozen enemies with hits.
Meginord&#39;s Vise - Life regeneration if the strength requirement is met through other equipped items or the player using The Baron.
Hunter-influenced gloves with % chance to Intimidate Enemies for 4 seconds on Hit or % chance to Unnerve Enemies for 4 seconds on Hit

Boots:

Victario&#39;s Flight - Aura that grants increased Movement Speed.
Atziri&#39;s Step - Life and Chance to Dodge Spell Hits.
Kaom&#39;s Roots - Life.
Bubonic Trail - Generally more life then Kaom&#39;s Roots, 1-2 abyssal socket version does not matter as mentioned above. Animated Guardian does not trigger Death Walk.

Weapons and/or Shields:

Singularity - Hinders nearby enemies.
Dying Breath - Aura that grants increased damage and makes curses more effective against affected enemies.
Victario&#39;s Charity - Chance to grant Frenzy Charges on hit and Power Charges on kill. (The replica version of this shield give Frenzy charge on kill, and Endurance charge on hit)
The Oak - Massive life regeneration.
The Anticipation - Intimidate enemies on block.
Kingmaker - Hugely beneficial aura that grants increased item rarity, Culling Strike, Critical Strike Multiplier and Fortify (note: with a very short range of 30 units).
Sign of the Sin Eater - Takes Elemental Ailments instead of you and other Minions. In order to survive being shocked or ignited, the Animate Guardian should be sufficiently tanky.
Oro&#39;s Sacrifice - In combination with Chains of Command
An Influenced weapon with a chance to Intimidate, Unnerver, or inflict Exposure on hit.

Also remember that your Animate Guardian can benefit from Enchantments on Boots and Corruptions.

Aura effects are always active whether the banner is placed or not.
Players and monsters must be inside the banners radius to receive the aura effects when the banner is placed on the ground.
Because dread banner has an aura that affects you and allies, it can be supported by generosity support. Generosity support will increase all aura effects, including those that affect enemies like less accuracy rating.

Buff effects

Fortify is a buff that can be modified by Increased Effect of fortify and Increased effect of buffs on you.
Increased Fortify effect per Stage: The increased Fortify effect only affects the Fortify granted by the banner itself.
Buffs are temporary effects that only occur after placing the banner with stages.
Destroying the placed banner early by creating a new carried banner will end the Fortify buff early if it has duration remaining.

Skill Effect Duration, Buff Duration, and Warcry Duration will not affect the duration of the life regeneration effect or the endurance charges created with the skill.

Endurance Charge Duration modifiers will affect the duration of the endurance charges created with the skill.



Cooldown Recovery:

Cooldown Recovery and Warcry Cooldown Recovery will reduce the cooldown time of Enduring Cry.

This effectively increases the average life regeneration granted by the skill, assuming the skill is used on cooldown.




Warcry Speed:

Warcry Speed will shorten the animation speed of enduring cry.

Cast Speed and Attack Speed have no effect on warcry skills, as warcry skills are neither attacks nor spells.

Warcries can be cast instantly by allocating the Call to Arms keystone

The debuff is not an Ignite, and is not affected by modifiers to Ignite or Ailments.
Increased Fire Damage: The Buff grants 0.75% increased Fire Damage from quality applies globally to all fire damage, including the extra fire damage effect of Herald of Ash.
More Spell Fire Damage: The more Spell Fire Damage applies globally to all spells, including spells with Modifiers to Spell Damage apply to this Skill&#39;s Damage Over Time effect. It does not apply to damage over time from spells without this modifier, such as Righteous Fire.
More Burning Damage: Unlike the more Spell Fire Damage, the more Burning Damage is not global. It only affects the burning debuff created by Herald of Ash itself.
Support gems: Any support gems (with the exception of Enhance Support) linked to the Herald of Ash will only affect the burn damage caused by the debuff, not the global modifiers. For example, linking Item Rarity Support to Herald of Ash will only apply rarity bonus to the enemies who die from the burn damage caused by Herald of Ash ignition.
Area of Effect: Area of Effect modifiers from passives, items, and gems affect the radius of the on-kill effect.
Culling Strike: When using an attack with culling strike, the overkill effect will only apply if the damage from the killing hit would have taken the monster to less than 0 life.

Strategy

In the case where enemy death occurs uniformly at random with respect to damage dealt, the chance of an enemy dying from a particular hit is proportional to the damage the hit deals. The mean overkill damage for that hit is half the damage of the hit. This makes the mean overkill damage overall equal to


0.5*(mean damage2)/mean damage

Consuming more endurance charges with the skill will also drastically increase duration.

Increased buff duration per endurance charge: Any other buffs that are applied when casting Immortal Call will also gain increased duration per endurance charge, including support gems that grant buffs. This mainly applies to Arcane Surge Support.

If immortal call is socketed into a weapon slot, the effect will end on weapon swap.

The less physical damage taken per endurance charged removed skill modifier is multiplicative with the innate less physical damage taken skill modifier.

For example, Level 1 Immortal Call with 5 endurance charges will give you a total of 81.25% less physical damage taken, not 100%.

    No longer makes you immune to physical damage for a duration. Base duration is now 1 second at all gem levels (from 0.4 seconds). Now has an instant cast time (from 0.85 seconds). Now causes you to take 25% less elemental damage and 25% less physical damage at gem level 1, with the values growing based on the gem level, up to 34% less elemental damage and 35% less physical damage at gem level 20. Now consumes endurance charges up to a maximum of 5, causing you to take 15% less physical damage per endurance charge consumed for the buff's duration. Increases the duration of the buff by 20% for each endurance charge consumed. Now has a 3 second cooldown, which does not recover during its effect. Shares its cooldown with other guard skills (Steelskin and Molten Shell).
    The Immortal Call enchantment which previously granted a chance to not consume endurance charges now grants increased Immortal Call duration per endurance charge consumed. This affects items that had the previous enchantment.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Consuming endurance charges now grants increased duration, instead of upping the base duration. The Base Duration has been increased from 250ms to 400ms. The Cooldown has been increased from 500ms to 3 seconds. The Quality now grants 2% increased cast speed per Quality.
  


  1.0.6
  
    Immortal Call, Blood Rage, Conversion Trap, Animate Weapon and Frost Wall have had their base duration increased by 25%.
  


  1.0.5

#### Infernal Blow (12)
- **Tags**: Attack, AoE, Melee, Strike, Fire, Duration
- **Class**: One Hand Swords
- **Requires**: Requires Level (12—70), (33—155) Str
- **Description**: Attacks with your weapon, applying a charged debuff to enemies hit by your strike, and an uncharged debuff to any other enemies hit. Upon reaching 6 charges, expiring, or the enemy's death, the charged debuff is removed to damage that and other surrounding enemies. Enemies with either debuff explode when they die, damaging other surrounding enemies. Damage from this explosion cannot be reflected. Requires a Sword, Axe, Mace, Sceptre, Staff or Unarmed.
- **Mods**: Base duration is 0.8 seconds | 60% of Physical Damage Converted to Fire Damage | Explosion deals base Fire Damage equal to 6% of the corpse's Maximum Life | Base radius is 2.4 metres | Base explosion radius is 1.8 metres | Debuff deals 66% of Damage per Charge | Tectonic Slam and Infernal Blow deal 1% increased Attack Damage per 700 Armour 
1000 (T5)Tectonic Slam and Infernal Blow deal 1% increased Attack Damage per 450 Armour | base_monster_will_be_deleted_on_death | melee damage, weapon damage or spell damage, but is affected by Elemental Damage with Attack Skills. While in a party, the explosion ignores the increased life added for each player beyond the first and treats the monster&#39;s life as if you were solo.1(#1)
The charged debuff explosion deals the exact same damage types as the melee hit, plus area damage.2(#2) Ruthless blows (Ruthless Support) are calculated differently depending on how the charged debuff explosion was caused. If the debuff reaches 6 stacks, then the hit that applied the 6th stack determines whether or not the explosion is Ruthless. If the debuff expires for any other reason (such as the monster dying) then the hit that applied the 1st stack determines whether or not the explosion is Ruthless.3(#3)
Monster Types: Magic (blue named) and rare (yellow named) monsters, and unique monsters (orange named) can be exploded.
Area of effect modifiers will only apply to the explosion itself, not the melee attack.

After the soul gain prevention timer has expired, the enemy can be killed by any non-vaal skill that can do damage over time and the character will gain all souls for all kills if they have room to store those kills. If the kill size outnumbers the souls per use in every situation, this combination can be repeated over and over again. In other words in areas where you regularly kill 15 enemies or more at the same time, vaal ground slam will always have enough souls to be used on every pack of enemies.

#### Vigilant Strike (4)
- **Tags**: Attack, Melee, Strike
- **Class**: Claws
- **Requires**: Requires Level (4—70), (0—98) Str, (0—68) Int
- **Description**: Attacks enemies with a powerful melee strike which grants Fortification, reducing damage you take from hits. The cooldown can be bypassed by expending an Endurance Charge. Requires a Melee Weapon.
- **Mods**: Melee Hits Fortify for 8 seconds | Flicker Strike and Vigilant Strike's Cooldown can be bypassed by Power Charges instead of Frenzy or Endurance Charges | (10—15)% increased Armour | With at least 40 Strength in Radius, Hits with Vigilant Strike Fortify you and Nearby Allies for 8 seconds | (Fortifying grants an amount of Fortification based on the Damage of the Hit) | (Take 1% less Damage from Hits per Fortification. Maximum 20 Fortification) | Can&#39;t be Evaded causes any other source of this modifier, as well as accuracy in general, to be redundant.
Vigilant Strike can still miss if the target  Dodge
s or blocks.
Critical Strikes work as normal, but accuracy does not need to be checked.
Support gems:
Endurance Charge on Melee Stun Support will generate an endurance charge if Vigilant Strike stuns an enemy, allowing for continued use of the skill.
Stun Support can synergize with Endurance Charge on Melee Stun Support, increasing the chance that the attack will generate an endurance charge.
Multistrike Support will cause Vigilant Strike to repeat twice per attack, causing its cooldown and endurance charge expenditure to be more effective.
Endurance Charge on Melee Stun Support will only trigger on the first hit, if it stuns. Multistrike will also cause Vigilant Strike to automatically target nearby enemies, potentially increasing its total hit chance versus manually targeting.
Fortify Support will impart additional Fortify duration and increased melee physical damage, but its utility will be redundant.
Melee Splash Support works as usual, allowing Vigilant Strike to damage more than one target.



Fortify duration modifiers also apply to the fortify buff granted to allies.

Interaction w/ Blade Blast: When targeted by Blade Blast, the blades will detonate in sequence, increasing in AoE with subsequent detonations. The damage from these detonations scale solely from the Blade Blast skill.
Physical Damage: Because Blade Vortex deals physical damage, it can be boosted by supports and skills that are more commonly used to modify attacks, such as the Added Fire Damage Support gem and the Hatred aura.
Spell Damage: Despite the fact that it does physical damage, Blade Vortex is a spell and not an attack. It does not utilize weapon damage in any way. Blade Vortex is one of several skills that work in this manner. The others include Ethereal Knives, Bladefall, and Shockwave Totem. Its damage can be amplified by Spell Damage on items and passives from the skill tree, as well as support gems that increase spell damage.
Leech: Leech effects that apply to Spell damage and to damage types dealt by Blade Vortex (Physical by default) will work as usual. Note that leech effects which apply to attacks do not apply to Blade Vortex because it is a spell, not an attack.
Area of Effect: Increases and decreases in to Area of Effect from support gems, passives, and equipment will augment the radius in which the skill deals damage (e.g. Increased Area of Effect Support, Concentrated Effect Support and Carcass Jack).
Cast Speed: Faster Casting Support, Spell Echo Support, and Cast Speed from passives and gear will increase the rate at which blades are generated.
Duration: Increased Duration Support, Less Duration Support, and duration-modifying passives and equipment will affect the duration of the blades (including Temporal Chains on yourself.) It is possible to have multiple blades active at the same time, up to a maximum of 10 blades. Once the limit is reached, creating a new blade will simply remove the oldest existing active blade, similar to Summon Raging Spirit.
Poison: As Blade Vortex deals physical damage, it can easily scale poison damage.
Visual effect: Blade vortex&#39;s visual effect does not scale with Area of effect modifiers. Instead, to give a rough indication of radius, there are several versions of the knife effect, each rotating at a different radius. The skill will always try to have one knife using the largest-radius effect that&#39;s not larger than the actual radius of the skill, but that skill results in discrete visual changes where you need to reach a certain threshold before the next wider effect can be used. The full radius is always used mechanically.[2]
Multiple casts: When Blade Vortex is linked to Unleash Support, the damage is defined by the initial cast and does not inherit the less damage multiplier.[3] This behavior includes the  Greater Spell Echo Support
 from Pledge of Hands.

Sequential Projectiles and Repeat: When linked to Barrage Support Elemental hit will pick one element per projectile shot; Multistrike Support will pick a new element for each repeat.

Damage conversion: Elemental Hit has added damage of each element present on the gem. This flat damage may be converted normally. The selection of an element happens afterwards and does not retroactively change the results of conversion. 

Example: If the player allocates the keystone Avatar of Fire, 50% of all lightning damage and 50% of all cold damage are converted to fire. This includes the flat damage inherently present on the gem. When Elemental Hit chooses fire, it will then deal significantly more damage than if the player did not have Avatar of Fire.


Dual Wielding: Elemental Hit will alternate weapons while dual wielding.

    Fixed a bug which caused Elemental Hit to not increase its area of effect when hitting enemies afflicted by Scorch, Brittle or Sap (despite them being valid ailments).
    Fixed a bug where melee Elemental Hit attacks that would apply a relevant ailment to Elemental Hit's bonus would increase the area of effect for that hit, despite the ailment not yet being applied.
  


  3.10.0
  
    Modifiers to Melee Weapon and Unarmed Attack Range are now described as "+X to Melee Strike Range". The functionality hasn't changed. Weapons that describe their range still refer to "Weapon Range".

If the skill hits an enemy, it also deals damage in a small area around it. If the enemy is suffering from that element's associated ailment (ie. if it hits an ignited enemy with fire damage), the area component of the attack gets 80% more radius.
    Now deals 10% more damage per elemental ailment on enemies.
    Now has 30% chance to freeze, shock and ignite (up from 10%), which grows as the gem levels, up to 49% at gem level 20.

Projectile speed: The projectiles move at an average speed of close to 120 units/s for roughly 0.25 seconds, putting their effective range at somewhere around 30ish units. Then inherently have a variation of +/−40% base speed, but the average will be around 30. Modifiers to projectile speed will increase the average distance that Ethereal Knives projectiles travel before they fade, effectively increasing the maximum range of the spell.

Leech: Since it is a spell, Ethereal Knives is not affected by Physical Attack Damage Leeched as Life or Physical Attack Damage Leeched as Mana. However, unspecified leech such as Life Leech Support will function with Ethereal Knives.

Can be used in left mouse button slot to cast and move.

- **Tags**: Attack, Projectile, Melee, Strike, Lightning
- **Class**: Claws
- **Requires**: Requires Level (12—70), (21—98) Dex, (14—68) Int
- **Description**: Infuses your melee weapon with electrical energies as you swing.

The projectiles cannot miss if the melee attack hit a target.

So it will be based on the full base damage, not just the 50% physical part. This applies to both - melee damage and projectile damage.
Ancestral Call Support: If there are additional targets within range, Ancestral Call will target and attempt to strike additional enemies; these strikes will release projectiles in the direction of the target struck. Without additional targets, Lightning Strike will not swing aside from the main strike and thus not produce extra projectiles. However, against single targets, you can benefit from additional strikes from - Ancestral Call Support and other similar bonuses by attacking outside melee range. This will create two lightning strikes, one from - Ancestral Call which hits the target, and one from your own attack which will fire projectiles that can also hit the target.

    Fixed a bug where being punctured multiple times would cause incorrect behaviour.

- **Tags**: Attack, Projectile, Physical
- **Class**: Shields
- **Requires**: Requires Level (28—70), (29—68) Str, (42—98) Dex
- **Description**: Throws a spectral copy of your shield as a piercing projectile which deals off-hand damage augmented by the defences of the shield. When it reaches the targeted location it will hover in place, repeatedly firing a number of smaller shards as projectiles in all directions. The rate at which it releases shards will increase until all shards have been fired. Modifiers that cause additional projectiles to be fired will add more shards, not more copies of the shield.

#### Spectral Throw (1)
- **Tags**: Attack, Projectile
- **Class**: Claws
- **Requires**: Requires Level (1—70), (0—68) Str, (0—98) Dex
- **Description**: Throws a spectral copy of your melee weapon. It flies out and then returns to you, in a spinning attack that damages enemies in its path.
- **Implicit**: Your Spectral Throw becomes golden. | OLD - DO NOT USE | Your Spectral Throw projectile becomes a glowing, feathery wing. | Your Spectral Throw becomes a deadly scythe. | Your Spectral Throw becomes a demonic effect. | Your Spectral Throw becomes a triple blade effect.
- **Mods**: Each Projectile from Spectral Helix or Spectral Throw has / between 40% more and 40% less Projectile Speed at random 
1000 (T5)Each Projectile from Spectral Helix or Spectral Throw has / between 75% more and 75% less Projectile Speed at random | base is projectile [1] | spectral throw forget hit list time override [225] | (7—10)% increased Projectile Damage | With at least 40 Dexterity in Radius, each Spectral Throw Projectile gains 5% increased Damage each time it Hits | x% increased Attack Speed but not from x% increased Casting Speed. Similarly, it is a projectile rather than a melee attack and benefits from x% increased Projectile Damage and x% increased Damage (with Weapontype), such as x% Increased Physical Damage with Two Handed (or One Handed) melee weapons, but it will not benefit from mods such as x% Increased Melee Damage or x% increased Melee Physical Damage .

Range and Projectile Speed: The skill has a base range of ~45 units, or roughly 60% of the way to the right edge of the screen, which is increased by projectile speed.
Projectile Speed modifiers affect the initial speed but not the acceleration (approx. 109.09 units/second). Therefore, assuming the thrower stands still:

Duration is proportional to the projectile speed. The base duration for the projectile to return to its origin is ~1.833 seconds.

Range is proportional to the square of the projectile speed; even a level 1 Faster Projectiles Support will increase range by 69% which is sufficient to reach the edge of the screen. Targeting range is adjusted accordingly.

Projectiles travel their slowest when they are at their limit of the range and will therefore cause the maximum number of hits near there. Projectile speed affects the distance but not the effectiveness at which this occurs. With optimal positioning the skill can hit 3-4 times, or 4-5 times with the 30% reduced Spectral Throw Projectile Deceleration helm enchantment (depending on the size of the target).



Dual Wielding: Dual Wielding while using Spectral Throw will cause the player to alternate weapons each attack.

The size of the projectile is half of the weapon&#39;s base range (rounded down). Passive skills that affect the melee range have no effect.

    Quality no longer grants (0-10)% increased Effect of Curse. Instead, it grants (0-20)% increased Curse Duration.
    Anomalous quality no longer grants Curse has (0-40)% increased Doom gain rate. Instead, it now grants (0-20)% increased Area of Effect.
    Fixed a bug introduced in 3.12 where applying Temporal Chains in a way not from a Curse Skill, such as through Curse on Hit modifiers, was incorrectly applying Temporal Chains' 50% less effect on Players to all targets.
    Labyrinth Helmet Enchantments that provide increased Effect to a specific Hex now have values of 10% for the Merciless Enchantments (previously 20%), and 15% for the Eternal Enchantments (previously 30%).
  


  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Items which apply a Curse to an enemy (such as the curse-on-hit Ring modifiers) no longer specify a level, and instead have a set magnitude for their values with a fixed amount of Doom, which is overwritten when another source applies a more potent version (similar to Arcane Surge).
    Curses applied by casting Temporal Chains now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now gains additional radius as the gem levels, up to +10 at gem level 20 (from +7).
    Now gains 1% increased effect of Curse per 2% gem quality (previously caused normal and magic enemies to have 1% less action speed per 2% gem quality).
    Now offered Witch, Shadow and Scion for completing {{ql|Lost in Love}}, and can be purchased from Clarissa by the Ranger.
    Now has alternative gem quality.
  


  3.10.0
  
    Now has 50% less effect against players. Previously, it had 40% reduced effect against players. Note that this change means it is multiplicative with sources of increased curse effect.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 1 is now 16 (was 24).
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 33 (was 50).
    Now causes Normal and Magic enemies to have 20% less Action Speed at gem level 1, up to 29% less Action Speed at gem level 20.
    Now causes Rare and Unique enemies to have 10% less Action Speed at gem level 1, up to 14% less Action Speed at gem level 20.
  


  3.5.0
  
    The total amount that you can slow the expiration of an effect on a character through a time-slowing mechanism (such as Temporal Chains) is now capped at 75% from all sources.
  


  3.3.0
  
    Added new corrupted implicits which can appear on items corrupted by Vaal Orb, bringing the total to approximately 176. Many of the old implicits were buffed or moved to different items, and some were disabled. Generally, corrupted implicits are now more powerful on average.
    (Not in patch note) Temporal Chains Skill granted from boots corrupted implicit, is spawn disabled.
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Temporal Chains, Enfeeble, Curse on Hit and Blasphemy have had their quality bonuses returned to normal.
    A cap of 75% now applies to the action speed reduction caused by Temporal Chains.
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Temporal Chains quality now grants 0.5% increased Cast Speed per point of quality instead of slowing enemies by 0.5% per point of quality.
  


  2.0.2
  
    Temporal Chains' slowing effect now applies multiplicatively with Chill's slowing effect. This will result in less of an impact when both are used on the same target.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). Duration increases per level slightly modified. The end result is slightly longer duration at level 1 but slightly shorter duration at level 20.
  


  0.10.0
  
    Fixed a bug where chilling monsters or cursing them with Temporal Chains could  /  prevent their attacks from succeeding.
  


  0.9.13
  
    Reduced the effect of Temporal Chains, due to being overpowered in both PvE and PvP.  /  This also affects the version that Maps inflict on you
  


  0.9.12
  
    The quality bonuses have been corrected to not include movement speed,  /  as it is already part of the core effect.
  


  0.9.4
  
    Reduced the duration.
  


  0.9.2
  
    Temporal Chains has been added to the game.

Essence Drain: When an enemy affected by both Contagion and Essence Drain dies, the resulting Contagion proc will spread both effects. This is a unique interaction. Contagion will not spread other damage over time effects.

Duration: Increases and reductions to duration function normally. The duration of Contagion and associated degeneration effects (Essence Drain) is not reset when spread to other enemies on death.

Area of Effect: Modifiers to area of effect affect both the skill radius and spread radius of Contagion. Modifiers to area damage (such as Concentrated Effect Support) do not apply.

On hit effects: Contagion does not hit, and therefore cannot activate the effects of supports such as Hextouch Support.

This added damage is identical in function to other sources of added damage, such as Added Chaos Damage Support, and thus can be further increased by any of the applicable increases to the attacker&#39;s damage.

Cursed enemies have -x% to Chaos Resistance: The reduction to Chaos Resistance granted by this curse (after modifiers) stacks additively with the Occultist&#39;s Void Beacon Ascendancy passive and other similar effects.

Despair can be turned into an aura by linking it with either Blasphemy Support or Awakened Blasphemy Support.

By the same token, the 50% less effect removes itself immediately upon key release; it will not affect the beam, much in the way that Charged Dash functions.

Chance to gain additional stages: This chance is rolled independently per enemy hit. Hitting two rare/unique enemies at a time will generate two additional charges. On average, casting with 5 nearby normal or magic enemies will generate 2 additional charges per cast repetition.

Stages: 10 stacks for maximum width, 20 for maximum damage.

Totems: When used by totems via Spell Totem Support, the totems will fully charge up to 20 stages before firing. They will continue doing so even if there are no more valid targets within range, if they began channeling while the targets were still in range.

  3.15.0f
  
    Map Curse modifiers no longer have increased effect.

This was a restartless deploy of the patch so you will need to restart your client to receive the client changes, specifically the Map Curse modifier change requires a client restart to visually update descriptions.
  


  3.12.0
  
'' All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Items which apply a Curse to an enemy{{efn|name=Bex}} (such as the curse-on-hit Ring modifiers) no longer specify a level, and instead have a set magnitude for their values with a fixed amount of Doom, which is overwritten when another source applies a more potent version (similar to Arcane Surge).
    '''Elemental Weakness''': Curses applied by casting this spell now gain 10 Doom per second.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 1 is now 16 (was 24).
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 33 (was 50).
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). It now grants 0.25% reduced elemental resistances on cursed enemies per 1% quality (was 0.4% per 1% quality). 
  


  1.2.0
  
    Now gains -8% Enemy Resistances at 20% quality, instead of -10% at 20% quality.
  


  0.9.4e
  
     Fixed a bug where Chance to Ignite did not scale properly under Elemental Weakness.
  


  0.9.2
  
    Elemental Weakness has been added to the game.

#### Energy Blade (24)
- **Tags**: Spell, Lightning
- **Class**: Claws
- **Requires**: Requires Level (24—70), (58—155) Int
- **Description**: Grants a buff which significantly lowers your maximum Energy Shield to transform your equipped weapons into Swords formed from that energy. Casting the spell again removes the buff. Requires a Non-Bow weapon. This skill cannot be triggered.
- **Implicit**: Your Energy Blade becomes a Celestial Effect. | Adds  to  Lightning Damage | Adds  to  Lightning Damage | Skill functions and interactions

Energy Blades have (minimum/maximum) Lightning Damage equal to #% of Energy Shield: Using Energy Blades grants a buff that completely replaces your existing weapon(s), creating one handed Energy Blade(s) or a two handed Energy Blade based on your equipped weapon, Maximum Energy Shield. Note that the Lightning Damage granted is based on your current Maximum Energy Shield, which takes the Buff grants 50% less Maximum Energy Shield modifier into account, essentially giving you 50% of the Energy Shield you would have had with the buff off. Lightning Damage gained this way is added to the Energy Blades weapon as local weapon damage, and thus can be used with Battlemage.

Energy Blades stats: By default, a one-handed Energy Blade has 7% base Critical Strike Chance, 1.7 Attacks per Second, and 11 Weapon Range. Dual wielding while activating this buff will replace both weapons. A two-handed Energy Blade has 7% base Critical Strike Chance, 1.6 Attacks per Second, and 13 Weapon Range; it also inherently has 50% more Local Lightning Damage which is already factored in the weapon damage when activated.

Energy Blades have 10% increased Critical Strike Chance: The Superior Quality for this skill increases the base Critical Strike Chance of the Energy Blades, functionally similar to the #% increased Critical Strike Chance found on weapons. This modifier is separate from generic #% increased Critical Strike Chance found on items and the passive tree.

Support Gems: Because Energy Blades is a buff, and does not inherently do damage, this skill cannot be supported by Support Gems that require Hits. Currently, the only synergistic Support Gems include Empower Support, Enhance Support, and Faster Casting Support. While it can be supported by trigger gems, there are no trigger gems that currently work well with this skill.

  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    No longer causes cursed enemies to have reduced critical strike chance or critical strike multiplier.
    Curses applied by casting this spell now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now gains additional radius as the gem levels, up to +10 at gem level 20 (from +7).
    Now gains 1% increased effect of curse per 2% gem quality (previously granted 1% reduced accuracy rating per 5% gem quality and 1% reduced critical strike chance per 2% gem quality).
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 1 is now 16 (was 24).
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 33 (was 50).
    Now causes Normal and Magic enemies to deal 21% less Damage at gem level 1, up to 30% less Damage at gem level 20.
    Now causes Rare and Unique enemies to deal 10% less damage at gem level 1, up to 15% less damage at gem level 20
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.3.0
  
    Enfeeble now causes monsters to only lose 21% Critical Multiplier at Level 1 (down from 40%). This goes up by 1% every 2 gem levels, to -30% at gem level 20. A monster's base Critical Multiplier is +30%, so at level 20 this bonus is nullified. This makes it less effective when the monster has additional Critical Multiplier (through map or monster mods).
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Temporal Chains, Enfeeble, Curse on Hit and Blasphemy have had their quality bonuses returned to normal.
    A cap of 75% now applies to the action speed reduction caused by Temporal Chains and to the effects of Enfeeble.
  


  2.1.0c
  
    Enfeeble quality now grants 0.5% reduced enemy Critical Strike Multiplier per point of quality.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Mana cost reduced at all levels. The reduced critical strike chance and critical strike multiplier effects are now 25% at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). It now grants 0.5% reduced critical strike chance and accuracy on cursed enemies per 1% quality instead of just critical strike chance.
  


  1.2.0
  
    In addition to the general curse reduction, the duration of Enfeeble has been reduced.
  


  1.0.1
  
    The accuracy penalty given by quality has been halved.
  


  0.9.2
  
    Enfeeble has been added to the game.

Contagion: When an enemy affected by both Contagion and Essence Drain dies, Contagion will proc and spread the remaining duration of both effects to nearby enemies.

Regeneration: The amount of life regenerated from the damage over time caused by Essence Drain is dependent solely on the tooltip damage over time, and not on the actual damage dealt to the enemy. Essence drain will increase the players life regeneration by 0.005 * tooltip DoT per enemy affected. This means that increasing the damage an enemy receives through effects such as Despair, Wither, or the Occultist Void Beacon notable will not change the amount of regeneration provided by Essence Drain.

Traps and Mines: Essence Drain can not be supported by Trap Support and Blastchain Mine Support.

Explosion: The explosion added to Essence Drain in 3.6 only occurs on projectile destruction, similar to Fireball&#39;s explosion mechanic. Since the Essence Drain damage over time debuff is applied through this explosion any sort of subprojectile effect will cause the debuff to not affect a given target unless it is in range of the projectile itself being destroyed.

Cast speed: At base cast speed it takes 2 seconds to reach the maximum stage. Increasing the cast speed reduces the time to reach the next stage, similar to how Incinerate works.

Curses: The blast detonates ~0.5sec after releasing the key, giving the player enough time to cast a curse like Flammability or try to Shock, however this will only boost the damage of burn if targets get ignited because the blast goes off before the curse or shock stacks. Moving will set off the blast earlier.

Traps, Mines, and Triggers: The skill can&#39;t be cast by conditional trigger gems such as Cast when Damage Taken Support and Cast On Critical Strike Support.It also can&#39;t be linked to Trap Support or Blastchain Mine Support unless also linked to a totem.

Totems: When linked to Spell Totem Support, the totem stops channeling automatically at max stacks. Letting the totem die or expire will also release the blast.

Notes: Flameblast cannot be supported with Spell Cascade Support or Spell Echo Support.


Version history
VersionChanges

  3.17.0
  
    Flameblast now deals 31 to 46 Fire Damage at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 405 to 608 at gem level 20 (previously 280 to 419). 
    Now deals 165% more Spell Damage for each stage (previously 130%). 
    Now has 90% Effectiveness of Added Damage at all gem levels (previously 60%).
  


  3.16.0
  
    Flameblast now has 60% more Damage with Ailments for each Stage (previously 90%). Because of base Ignite damage changes, Ignite with the skill is now 75.0% higher at 10 Stages.
  


  3.15.0
  
    Now has 130% more Spell Damage for Each Stage (previously 110%).
  


  3.13.0
  
    No longer has +5% chance to ignite for each stage.
    Now has 50% chance to ignite at all gem levels.
    Divergent Flameblast now grants 1% less cast speed per 1% gem quality (from 2% per 1% gem quality).
  


  3.12.4
  
    Fixed a bug where Divergent '''Flameblast''''s Less Cast Speed effect was not displayed.
  


  3.12.0
  
    Now has alternative quality.
  


  3.10.0
  
    Now has a base radius of 2 (from 5).
    Now gains +3 radius per stage (from +2).

    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 7 (was 6).

  2.4.0c
  
    Improved Totem AI when used with Flameblast so that it ends the channel correctly once it has reached max stacks.
  


  2.4.0
  
    Added a channelled skill system. Incinerate, Flameblast and Wither are now channelled skills.
    Unlike other skills, which are used once and quickly finish, when you use a channelled skill, it doesn't finish until you release the relevant button/key. You continue performing the same skill.
    You need to pay Mana repeatedly to keep the skill going. The channelled skill's mana cost must be paid again to maintain it with a frequency determined by the cast time. If you can't pay, the skill will end, just as if you'd lifted the button.
    Dying, being stunned, and other game mechanics that interrupt the use of skills will cause channelling to end as well.
    Effects which trigger when you use a skill will only trigger when you initially start channelling - regardless of how long you maintain a channelled skill, it's still the same use of the skill. You need to stop channelling if you want to use it again.
  


  2.1.0
  
    Damage has been increased by around 20% at all levels.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Now grants 1% increased damage per 1% quality (quality no longer affects ignite chance).

    We have reduced the critical strike chance from 6% to 5%. We have reduced the damage by 15% at all levels.
  


  1.1.1

  1.0.4
  
    Flameblast has been added to the game.

  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Curses applied by casting '''Flammability''' skill now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now causes Hexed enemies to have 25% chance to be Ignited at all gem levels (from 10% at gem level 1, up to 14% at gem level 20).
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Resistance reduction increased by 5% at all levels. Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). Normalised the increased duration per gem level. Flammability now grants 0.5% increased burn duration on cursed enemies per 1% of quality (was 1% per 1% quality).
  


  0.9.13
  
    Flammability has been added to the game

  3.12.0
  
''All curse skills have been reworked and are now divided into two categories: Hexes and Marks.''
    Hexes apply a curse in an area and, when manually cast, apply an amount of Doom per second to cursed enemies up to a maximum. Doom increases the effect of the afflicted curse and stacks additively with modifiers to increased Curse effect.
    Curses applied by casting this spell now gain 10 Doom per second.
    Now causes Hexed enemies to have 25% chance to be Frozen at all gem levels (from 10% at gem level 1, up to 14% at gem level 20).
  


  2.6.0
  
    Increased Area of Effect mod and its progression per level doubled.
  


  2.0.0
  
    Resistance reduction increased by 5% at all levels. Mana cost reduced at all levels. Area of effect increases per gem level reduced, but the base area of effect has been increased by 37.5% (from 16 to 22). Normalised the increased duration per gem level
  


  0.9.13
  
    Frostbite has been added to the game.

Quality: Herald of Thunder&#39;s increased lightning damage quality bonus is global, meaning that it affects the character&#39;s lightning damage from all sources, not only Herald of Thunder.

Cannot Apply Shock: Herald of Thunder&#39;s on-kill effect cannot apply Shock. However, if The Three Dragons is equipped, the storm can apply Freeze.

Delay time is skill effect duration and is affected by skill effect duration stats including skill gem&#39;s one. Base time for delay is calculated as a time needed for character to normally run the euclidean distance between position where the spell was cast and exit position with character&#39;s current movement speed. Because of that movement speed stats (including conditional ones, auras, etc) also affects delay time. It is not possible to completely eliminate this delay because there is a hidden 0.1 second delay added to it.

Sequence of operations: The lightning explosion occurs before the caster leaves and after the caster arrives. This will, for example, cause the caster to take damage from monsters that explode on death that are killed by Lightning Warp.

Death: If the caster dies before the teleport executes, the teleport will still execute, transporting the caster&#39;s corpse to the targeted location.

Can be used in left mouse button slot to cast and move.


Strategy
Movement
Lightning Warp is primarily used as a movement skill. To improve Lightning Warp&#39;s effectiveness as a movement skill, one should support it with Less Duration Support, Faster Casting Support, and Swift Affliction Support. If only one support gem can be used, [[
Less Duration Support]] will generally result in faster travel. Taking increased Skill Effect Duration passives will render Lightning Warp much less useful as a movement skill, in which case you may want to consider alternatives such as Flame Dash, Leap Slam, Whirling Blades.
Compared with Leap Slam, Lightning Warp has the advantages of not requiring any particular weapon, potentially higher speed, and slightly longer range. However, it costs more mana and requires three support gems to be fully effective. Compared with Flame Dash, Lightning Warp has the advantage of being able to be cast as many times as possible, but costs slightly more mana and has a noticeable delay.
With Arctic Armour
Lightning Warp can be used as a method of travel when using Arctic Armour, since this will allow the player to always remain stationary and thus always receive Arctic Armour&#39;s less Damage taken while stationary bonus.

As Spellslinger Support: &quot;Supports spell skills that do not reserve mana. Cannot support skills used by totems, traps or mines. Cannot modify the skills of minions.&quot; Trigger Supported Spells when you fire Projectiles from a Non-Triggered Wand Attack, Supported Skills have Added Spell Damage equal to (50-100)% of Damage of Equipped Wand. If two Wands are Equipped, each contributes half as much Added Damage and Supported Skills have (0-38)% increased Cooldown Recovery Rate. Lastly, a mana reservation override to the supported active skill. The active skill part toggles the the mana reservation on/off.
The active skill supported by Spellslinger can be triggered when using the basic attack with a wand equipped, or while using a wand-based skill with a wand equipped.

You link Spellslinger Support to one or more spell active skill gems like a standard support gem. Those spells become unavailable for normal use.

You have to turn on the active skill part of Spellslinger gem , which reserve mana like aura, herald and aspect skill, in order to activate the function of the Spellslinger Support part of the gem.

The default mana reserve of the Spellslinger skill itself is 0%. For each active spell linked to it you will reserve additional (30-25)% mana (or even less), depending on the gem level of Spellslinger. The base reservation value can be seen in the &quot;Spellslinger Support&quot; section of the Spellslinger gem tooltip in-game. If you don&#39;t have enough mana available to support all linked spells, the Spellslinger ability will not be available.

Despite the gem claims the amount of mana reserved is not able to be further modified, it can be modified by the lab enchantment, mana multiplier from support gem as well as reduced mana reserve from passive skill and jewel implicit, etc. The wording and cannot be further modified probably refer to the mana reserve cannot double dip, as aforementioned sources of mana reserve reduction only affected linked skill gem but not affecting Spellslinger (which is the sum of mana reserve of the linked skill gem despite it is not actually reserve twice).

With the Spellslinger is active and reserving mana, if you fire a wand projectile, every linked spell triggers simultaneously, without their standard mana-on-use cost.

The Spellslinger effect applies a 0.6 second Cooldown to linked spells by default. Spells with their own cooldown period that is longer than this (such as Cold Snap) will use their own cooldown, and your wand will just fire its normal projectiles during this time. For zero cooldown spells with a Casting Time (like Ice Spear or Freezing Pulse
), they instead inherit the 0.6 second cooldown of Spellslinger; even if you can fire your wand faster than every 0.6 seconds, the linked spells will not fire until Spellslinger&#39;s cooldown is done and the wand will just fire normal shots. Attack and Cast speed modifiers have no effect on cooldown. Cooldowns are shared between multiple instances of the same spell linked to any Spellslinger gem.


Cost
As of patch 3.15, spellslinger requires the user to sped the cost, be it mana or life, each time you attack to actually use the skill.

Version history
VersionChanges

  3.19.0
  
    The damage and life scaling values for minions have been adjusted. Generally speaking, minion life and damage is unchanged in the very early game, roughly 30% lower in mid acts, roughly 20% lower at level 20 of the minion skill, and roughly 10% lower at level 30 of the minion skill.
    Summon Raging Spirit no longer has Minions gain 15% less Added Damage. 
    Now has Minions deal 0% more Damage at gem level 1, up to 38% more Damage at gem level 20 (previously 0%). 
    Minion base life is now 20% higher at all levels. 
    Now costs 4 mana at gem level 1 (unchanged), up to 16 at gem level 20 (previously 12). 
    The Helmet Enchantments that grant a chance to summon an extra Minion now grant a 16% chance from the Merciless Labyrinth (previously 12%) and a 24% chance from the Eternal Labyrinth (previously 18%). 
  


  3.16.0
  
    Summoned Raging Spirits now convert all of their Damage to Fire Damage.
  


  3.6.0
  
    Mana Cost at gem level 20 is now 16 (was 12).
    Raging Spirits, Raised Zombies, 'of the Grave' enchantment minions, and Spectral Spirits (from Essence of Insanity on a weapon) now have 100% more base accuracy rating than previously. Raging Spirits mana cost changes have been undone.
  


  3.1.0
  
    Summon Raging Spirit now have a 15% less Added Damage multiplier, up from 30%.

  2.5.0
  
    Reduced the maximum number of Summoned Raging Spirits to 20, but we have also increased damage as the gem levels up to compensate. It's intended to be a similar damage output but with less casting needed and less effective area of effect.
    Totems and all other minions now have 40% elemental resistance and 20% chaos resistance. This also includes minions that didn't have resistances previously, like wolves.
  


  2.1.0
  
    Summon Raging Spirit's duration has been increased from 3.5 seconds to 5 seconds. The mana cost has been reduced from 6 to 5 at level one and reduced from 15 to 12 at level 20. The cast speed has been reduced to 500ms from 800ms. The damage dealt by Raging Spirits has been substantially reworked and is lower at high levels. Raging Spirits are now more likely to target enemies who are attacked by fewer Raging Spirits, except when enemies are close to the caster.
  


  1.3.0
  
    Raging Spirits have had their damage reduced at higher levels. There's no change at gem level 9, scaling to 8% less damage at level 20 of the gem.
  


  1.2.0
  
    The damage done by the summoned Raging Spirits has been reduced at higher levels, up to a 20% reduction in damage at level 20.

The skill itself is not an Aura, even though it has an Aura Gem tag and reserves mana like every other Aura in the game. Therefore it wont be counted towards amount of Auras player has. This is especialy usefull for builds that utilise mechanics that limit the amount of Auras player can have, for example Keystones like Supreme Ego or Mortal Conviction.

Chilling and Shocking Auras are a property of Skitterbot minions, not a player so they wont benefit from modifiers affecting player Auras like &quot;Increased Effect of Non-Curse Auras&quot; or &quot;Increased Area of Effect of Non-Curse Auras&quot;.

  1.1.0d
  
    Vaal Skill soul counts were initially balanced for Merciless difficulty, where there are more monsters. We want them to be easier to use in Normal and Cruel difficulty. We have halved the number of souls required for each skill. In Cruel difficulty, skills require 50% more souls to uses. In Merciless difficulty, they require 100% more (which is the same as before the patch).

Frostbolt: The player may cast Frostbolt and subsequently cast Vortex on the Frostbolt projectiles. If Vortex is cast this way, it will have 20% less area of effect and it may cast on up to 5 Frostbolt projectiles, consuming them.

If the player has any active Frostbolt projectiles and Vortex is triggered by an effect (such as Cast On Critical Strike Support), Vortex will automatically be cast on the Frostbolt projectiles.


Overlap: If an enemy is standing on multiple Vortex ground effects, only the one with the highest damage per second will deal damage at any given moment. This is consistent with other damage over time ground effects, such as burning ground.

Cast time: Vortex is an instant spell; it has no cast time and does not interrupt your character&#39;s other actions.

On hit effects: Because the initial explosion counts as a hit, Vortex can be used with on hit effects such as Hextouch Support.
